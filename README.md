# 🌱 Circular Economy Marketplace: Where Trash Gets a Second Chance! 🌱

Welcome to the place where "one person's trash is another person's treasure" isn't just a saying—it's a business model!

## 🚮 What Is This?

This is a marketplace for materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, oceans, or wherever else humans typically dump things they don't want. Instead of saying "goodbye forever" to perfectly good materials, we're saying "see you later, in another form!"

## ✨ Features

- **Material Matchmaking**: Like a dating app, but for waste materials and companies that might want them
- **Supply Chain Tracking**: Follow your trash's journey to becoming treasure
- **Impact Dashboard**: Brag about how much waste you've diverted (we won't tell anyone you're just trying to save money)
- **Logistics Integration**: Because your trash needs a ride to its new home

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with React, Node.js, and the tears of developers who realized how much perfectly good stuff we throw away every day.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` (because who doesn't love waiting for dependencies to install)
3. Start the server with `npm start`
4. Start making the world slightly less trashy!

## 👩‍💻 For Developers

Our code is like the materials on our platform: ready to be reused, recycled, and repurposed! Feel free to contribute, but remember—spaghetti code goes in the compost bin.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Because the planet is kind of important, and we should probably try not to fill it with garbage.

Happy recycling! 🔄
