        <Introduction>
          <p>
            By using our platform, you acknowledge that you have not read a single word of this 
            agreement, will never read it, and wouldn't understand it even if you did. 
            Nevertheless, you're legally bound by every ridiculous clause we've included below.
          </p>
        </Introduction>
        
        <TermsSection>
          <SectionTitle>1. Acceptance of Terms</SectionTitle>
          
          <Paragraph>
            By accessing this website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, all applicable laws, 
            regulations, and <ImportantText>the whims of our legal department</ImportantText>, 
            and you agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws, 
            even the ones you've never heard of.
          </Paragraph>
          
          <Paragraph>
            If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing 
            this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by copyright, trademark, 
            and other laws that we're pretty sure exist.
          </Paragraph>
          
          <SillyText>
            Our legal team spent 48 consecutive hours drafting this section while surviving on nothing 
            but energy drinks and spite.

        <TermsSection>
          <SectionTitle>2. Use License</SectionTitle>
          
          <Paragraph>
            Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials on our website 
            for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, 
            not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
          </Paragraph>
          
          <List>
            <li>Modify or copy the materials in any way that might make them better than our original design;</li>
            <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, including the perfectly reasonable ones;</li>
            <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on our website, even if it's to fix our bugs;</li>
            <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
            <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server, even if that server is more reliable than ours.</li>
          </List>
          
          <Paragraph>
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be 
            terminated by us at any time for any reason or no reason at all. <ImportantText>We reserve the right to terminate 
            your license while you're in the middle of something important.</ImportantText>
          </Paragraph>
          
          <SillyText>
            We definitely won't exercise this right when you're about to complete a 2-hour form submission process.

            When you create an account, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times.

          <Paragraph>
            <ImportantText>You are responsible for safeguarding the password</ImportantText> that you use to access the website and for 
            any activities or actions under your password. We recommend using a password that you've never used anywhere else,

            and one emoji.
          </Paragraph>
          
          <SillyText>
            Recommended password example: "Tr0ub4dor&3ðŸ˜‚ð“‚€" (Please don't actually use this password. Or do. We're a terms page, not the police.)

            By using our website, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of our Cookie Policy,

          </Paragraph>
          
          <SillyText>
            We use exactly 217 cookies, including but not limited to: chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and essential tracking.
